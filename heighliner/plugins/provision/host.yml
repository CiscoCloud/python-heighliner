# TODO: We are pulling in the roles from cis-tools right now, and this works
# because of the way the ansible.cfg is set on the build server. Eventually
# we may want to migrate the roles into heighliner as it is the interface for
# tenants that allows SDLC to maintain control over base provision state. This
# allows us to ensure admins always have credentials on the instances.
